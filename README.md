# PhoXtruder
Open Source design for extruding Magnesia-Phosphate cement.

## What is Magnesium Phosphate Cement (MPC)?
Magnesium phosphate ceramics (MPC) have been in use since ancient times and have recently been making something of a comeback as “green cement”. Premixed powder formulations are commercially available as Grancrete, Ceramicrete, Bindan Monopatch, and other products. Compared to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), it can cure at relatively cold temperatures, almost to freezing, and cure in minutes, resulting in a stronger and more hermetic material, with less thermal expansion. It also takes far less energy to produce, making it the "green" alternative.

## Why an extruder?
One thing inhibiting the adoption of this material is the fast cure time - the slurry pot life is unforgiving and large volumes can lose strength due to water cavitation caused by the fast exothermic reactions. This has caused problems in the construction industry with manually poured foundation methods. However, these characteristics could become much more advantageous when done with additive printing techniques, particularly considering that the MPC chemistry utilizes covalent bonds that adhere rather than merely encapsulating (as OPC does). Progressively applying thin layers of fast curing MPC offers to provide a potentially strong and versatile construction method.  

## Why open source?
For one, that is where the talent is in the 3D printing world.  For another thing, this is a technology that needs to be shared to help people now in need of housing.  Finally, it is my dream to really save humanity and eventually use this technology to autonomously construct habitats on Mars, where phosphates are 5 times as abundant as on Earth.

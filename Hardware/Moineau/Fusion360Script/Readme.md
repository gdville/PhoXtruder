Creates an epicyclic helical rotor and stator. The rotor will typically need a shaft added. The stator generated is actually the solid model of the stator cavity. As the stator is frequently molded out of silicone, this allows the user to use the generated model for creating the mold tool, as well as more latitude in creating the external stator geometry (from which the generated stator body can be cut via a boolean operation).

The rotor needs to be a relatively rigid, hard material, with a strong shaft. This design is for a steel shaft and fiberglass epoxy (e.g. "Bondo") composite rotor.

It can be manufactured by doing the following:
1. Make an ABS print of the rotor (simplest is to print half lengthwise twice and glue the halves together). Use acetone to smooth and seal the surface so that it will not adhere to the silicone mold. A film of soap may also help for mold release (DO NOT use a silicone based mold release product, as it will only enhance adhesion to the silicone mold!).
2. Use silicone mold making epoxy to create a rotor mold. This mold can be the same material used in making the stator. A toilet paper tube can be used to contain the mold while it cures. 
3. Prepare a 5mm steel rod (a 7/16" lag bolt can be ground down for this purpose) as the shaft. Grind some flats and rough the surface to improve adhesion. Dry fit the shaft and mark the depth where it should leave the mold.
4. Mix the fiberglass and resin, adding hardener, then pack into mold, squeezing out any air bubbles (it's good to leave an overflow at the bottom of the mold to prevent air entrapment). 
5. Insert the shaft up to the depth mark you made. Cure the resin.

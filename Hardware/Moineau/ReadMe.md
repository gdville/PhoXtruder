The Moineau pump is a controlled method of pumping slurries. Moineau pumps are comprised primarily of a rotor and a stator. The rotor is usually driven eccentrically while the stator is held in place.

In addition to the rotor and stator, this design includes:
* manifold - house the gears and provide inlets for the slurries to enter and mix
* planetary gear set - eccentrically drive the rotor
* motor - stepper motor drives the gears (might be better to use brushless DC motor appropriately geared down to provide high torque)
* nozzle - shapes the extrusion

The moineau pump is the recommended method of pumping slurries, as viscosity does not really effect the flow rate.

Moineau pumps are comprised primarily of a rotor and a stator. The rotor is (usually) driven eccentrically while the stator is held in place.

In addition to the rotor and stator, this design includes:

manifold - house the gears and provide inlets for the slurries to enter and mix
planetary gear set - eccentrically drive the rotor
motor - drives the gears
nozzle - shapes the extrusion

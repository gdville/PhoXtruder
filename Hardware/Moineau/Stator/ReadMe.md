# Stator
The stator body is made from silicone, and enclosed in 1" PVC, with PLA or ABS caps.

Included here is a model of the stator itself. However, to manufacture it in silicone you can do the following:
1. 3D print in ABS the mold insert and cap. If you want to remove the insert in one piece use a high amount of infill. Smooth both with acetone, and apply soap film or other mold release agent (DO NOT use a silicone based mold release as it will only enhance adhesion of the silicone mold material).
2. Cut a length of 1" PVC (schedule 40), and insert into the base of the stator mold insert. Insert 1/8" drill bits (3 total) into the holes near the top. Attach the cap with a wood screw to the top of the stator insert.
3. Mix and pack your [silicone material](https://rawmaterialsuppliers.com/product/magikmold-gt-1350/)  into the mold you've made. Fill to the top of the PVC.
4. After the silicone has set, unscrew the cap and remove. Remove the drill bits and then remove the insert body. The silicone stator should remain in the PVC which will be the housing for it.
